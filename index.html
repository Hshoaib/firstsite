    <p>I suppose firebreathing is fairly common as far as dramatic spectacles go, so it may surprise you to know that it was only recently that I saw one in person for the first time. While large plumes of fire are initially exciting, I found the other parts of the performace, juggling burning sticks and twirling burning battons, to be more entertaining. Partly because they allowed me to experiment with some longer shutter speeds to produce interesting results.</p>
    <p>So to sum up my experience was:</p>
    <ul><li>Exciting</li>
    	<li>Thrilling</li>
    	<li>Entertaining</li></ul>
